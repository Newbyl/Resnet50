### How does it work ?

I used tensorflow for this implementation.

You can find examples of how to use it in the `Resnet_Example.ipynb` file.

### Files

The model implementation is in the `resnet50.py` file. There is also several useful functions for Layers and datasets related import functions in the resnets_utils.py

I used the implementation I did for an exercices from Andrew Ng's course from Coursera : https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning
